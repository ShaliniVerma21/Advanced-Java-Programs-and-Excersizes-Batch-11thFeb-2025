<!-- 
JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library) is a collection of useful tags 
that encapsulate core functionality common to many JSP applications. 
It simplifies the development of JSP pages by providing tags for common 
tasks such as iteration, conditionals, and formatting.

Key Features of JSTL:

1. Core Tags: These tags provide basic functionality such as iteration 
   and conditionals.
   - <c:forEach>: Iterates over a collection.
   - <c:if>: Conditional rendering.
   - <c:choose>, <c:when>, <c:otherwise>: Similar to switch-case statements.
  
2. Formatting Tags: These tags help in formatting numbers, dates, and messages.
   - <fmt:formatDate>: Formats a date.
   - <fmt:formatNumber>: Formats a number.

3. SQL Tags: These tags allow you to interact with databases directly from 
   JSP (though it's generally recommended to use a more MVC-oriented approach).
   - <sql:query>: Executes a SQL query.
  
4. XML Tags: These tags provide support for XML processing.
   - <x:out>: Outputs XML content.
